# Easy Deployer Hub

Universal deploy platform:  
GitHub repository → automatic Docker build → live URL.

## What is this?
Easy Deployer Hub is a platform that takes a GitHub repository and automatically deploys it as a running service.
No manual Docker, no server setup, no CI/CD configuration.

Frontend, backend, APIs, static sites — all handled the same way.

## Current status
This project is in early development.

Current stage: Stage 1 — Backend Skeleton

## How it works (high-level)
1. User logs in with GitHub
2. Selects a repository
3. Platform analyzes the project
4. Generates deployment configuration
5. Builds and runs the project
6. Returns a public URL

## Development stages
See `docs/stages.md`
